  "body": "ATS: The Advanced Terrestrial Simulator\r\n=======================================\r\n\r\nThe Advanced Terrestrial Simulator (also know as the Arctic Terrestrial Simulator) is code for solving ecosystem-based, integrated, distributed hydrology.\r\n\r\nCapabilities are largely based on solving various forms of Richards equation coupled to a surface flow equation, along with the needed sources and sinks for ecosystem and climate models.  This can (but need not) include thermal processes (especially ice for frozen soils), evapo-transpiration, albedo-driven surface energy balances, snow, biogeochemistry, plant dynamics, and much more.\r\n\r\n\r\nGetting the code\r\n----------------\r\n\r\nIf you just plan on using ATS and think what you want is likely in a recent release, please prefer to use the most recent [release version available here](https://github.com/amanzi/ats-dev/releases).\r\n\r\nIf you instead expect to do new development, please use the developer version and clone the [ats-dev repository](http://github.com/amanzi/ats-dev) using:\r\n\r\n```\r\ngit clone http://github.com/amanzi/ats-dev\r\n```\r\n\r\nNOTE: there is also an ats repository that is currently simply a placeholder for better project pages to come.  Cloning that repository will do you no good!\r\n\r\n\r\nInstallation\r\n------------\r\n\r\nPlease see the [INSTALL](https://github.com/amanzi/ats-dev/blob/master/INSTALL) file included in the top level directory of your ATS download, or the [ats-dev wiki](https://github.com/amanzi/ats-dev/wiki).\r\n\r\n\r\nLicense and Copyright\r\n---------------------\r\n\r\nPlease see the [LICENSE](https://github.com/amanzi/ats-dev/blob/master/LICENSE) and [COPYRIGHT](https://github.com/amanzi/ats-dev/blob/master/COPYRIGHT) files included in the top level directory of your ATS download.",
